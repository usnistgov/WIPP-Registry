        <p>
            This system allows for the registration of WIPP resources, bridging the gap between existing resources and
            the end users. The Registry functions as a centrally located service, making the
            registered information available for research to the WIPP community, such as WIPP plugins, test datasets and informational websites about the WIPP framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is being developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and is made available to share WIPP resources. Please do not enter any proprietary data into this system.
